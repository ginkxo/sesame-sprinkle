# sesame-sprinkle
small generator of dot &amp; space fields -

## how to use

(still in progress)
1. clone this repository
2. import sesame
3. set up a Sesame(height, width, percentage of seeds as a decimal)
4. call sesame.display() to display with borders, and sesame.display_borderless() to display without
5. when calling sesame.export() you will require a command line input (i'll change this later for now)

this'll go to pypi soon i think, have fun!
